# Slowloris
Exact replica of Slowloris, except for the fact it is Python ;)

SSL (HTTPS) will be added very soon. I'm very very tired so I couldn't add it just yet, despite being an optional argument.

Star this repository if you think it's a good recode

As a reminder, this has been coded poorly solely so the code-base itself looks as similar as possible to the original Slowloris
